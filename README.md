# Currency Converter Application

Developed by @animalworldng

A project under the #7 days of code chalenge in the ALC 3.0 program sponsored by Google, Andela and Udacity.



The application is aimed to serve the purpose of converting currencies of about 10 countries.

It is intended to serve an offline-first functionality, such that when users visits and use the application for the first time, a second use may not require an active internet connection for functionality.

It utilises the service worker, indexed DB and Cache API technologies.
